### Consolidating Student Management Databases into a Unified Relational Database
## John Chung, Daniela Alejandra Gonzalez, Noah Rae-Grant
## DS 5110 - Fall 2024

Our final project addresses a real-world challenge: creating a relational database for an educational institution that currently lacks a DBMS (database management system). The project is grounded in the specific needs and requests of an actual independent high school, referred to as "Academy X" in this report. Academy X aims to better understand trends in student outcomes by leveraging data from its Admissions Office and College Counseling Office.
This project explores the practical challenges of integrating siloed databases and demonstrates the use of SQL queries and visualizations to generate high-value insights for the institution.
